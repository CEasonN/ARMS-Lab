This experiment revolves around a height offset monitoring camera that records the directed energy deposition process. After the camera was installed, our graduate researchers observed some distortion in the cameraâ€™s images. They suspected that the distortion occurs as the heat from the deposition accumulates in the camera and its mounting apparatus.
Therefore, our objective is to characterize and quantify the heat transfer into the camera using an approximation for the clad temperature and clad area. We will then use these calculations to determine a failure condition for the camera and identify its critical component along with its thermal limit. Finally, we will validate our calculations by attaching thermocouples to the camera and conducting a circular deposition until a steady state response is reached. This constant heat addition will allow us to investigate a worst-case scenario for the camera. If necessary, a thermal management solution will be designed and implemented to mitigate overheating.
